# Hiya! Jasper here.Â ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a penultimate software engineering student, student representative and teaching assistant at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz).

Iâ€™m also an alumnus of [AUT](https://www.aut.ac.nz), where I majored in Communication Design, specialising in UX/UI Design. My minor was in Creative Sound Design.

Come and say hi [on Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@jasperlai), if thatâ€™s your thing! Otherwise, I list the best ways to contact me on my website:

My presence on GitHub isâ€¦ quiet. (Part of this comes down to GitHubâ€™s [questionable ML model training practices](https://llmlitigation.com).)

Several of my projects are rooted in academic assignments, which I canâ€™t share publicly without substantial modification. Iâ€™m also somewhat of a type enthusiast, so side projects of mine often involve using font files which I have only licensed for personal use.

That said, I enjoy talking about stuff Iâ€™ve made as much as anyone else. If youâ€™re a recruiter whoâ€™s here because, say, youâ€˜ve had a squiz at my CV, Iâ€™m happy to share source code privately. Shoot me [an email](&#109;&#97;&#73;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#106;&#64;&#108;&#97;&#105;&#46;&#110;&#122;)!

Thanks for dropping by! ðŸ¥³
